## Reversi_Game
- A 6x6 Reversi Game programmed on Android Studio using Java.

### Rules
- There will be two player in each session of the game: One as a BLACK player, and the other is WHITE.
- Each player will take turn placing their color piece (BLACK or WHITE). Their choice of play must be a "valid play". If there is no "valid play" for the current player to place their color piece, that player's turn is skipped.
- It is consider to be a "valid play" when: The current player's piece can block both sides of the opponent's piece (one piece or a whole row). Those blocked piece will then consider "captured" and turn into the current player's pieces.
- The game ends when there is no more possible placement from both players. The player with the higher score (by counting the total pieces that the player won) will win the game.
